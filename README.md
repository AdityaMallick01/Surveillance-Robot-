# ü§ñ Web-Controlled Surveillance Robot Using Raspberry Pi

## Project Overview

This project details the design and implementation of a **Web-Controlled Surveillance Robot** powered by a **Raspberry Pi** for **real-time remote monitoring**. The system allows a user to remotely control the robot's movement (forward, backward, left, right) and receive a live video feed via a standard web browser on any internet-enabled device.

The robot functions as an **IoT-enabled device**, combining a mobile platform, a camera module, and a lightweight web server (Flask) hosted on the Raspberry Pi. This makes it a cost-effective, flexible solution suitable for applications in home security, industrial surveillance, and monitoring hazardous environments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time Remote Monitoring:** Stream live video footage from the robot's camera to a web-based interface.
* **Web-Based Control:** Control the robot's directional movement (forward, backward, left, right) remotely using buttons on a simple web GUI.
* **Cost-Effective Design:** Utilizes affordable hardware components like the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and open-source software (Python, Flask, OpenCV).
* **Wireless Communication:** Uses **Wi-Fi** for real-time data transmission and control over a local network or the internet.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Built with modular components, allowing for future enhancements such as object detection or autonomous navigation.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### 1. Hardware Assembly

1.  **Mount Components:** Assemble the motors, wheels, and Raspberry Pi/Camera Module onto the chassis.
2.  **Motor Driver Connection:** Connect the **L298N Motor Driver** to the DC Motors.
3.  **Raspberry Pi Interfacing:** Connect the motor driver's control pins to the designated **GPIO pins** on the Raspberry Pi. The GPIO pins used in the code are **29, 31, 33, and 35** for `Motor_In1` through `Motor_In4` respectively.
4.  **Camera Connection:** Connect the Pi Camera Module to the Raspberry Pi's CSI port.
5.  **Power:** Connect the power supply to both the Raspberry Pi and the motor driver (ensure correct voltage for each).

### 2. Software Configuration

1.  **OS and Libraries:** Install the Raspberry Pi OS on the MicroSD card.
2.  **Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries on the Raspberry Pi using the terminal:

    ```bash
    # Install Flask
    pip install Flask

    # Install OpenCV for video processing
    # Use the appropriate command for your RPi OS version
    pip install opencv-python

    # Install the camera control library
    pip install picamera2
    ```

3.  **Code Transfer:** Upload the project code (specifically the `main` script and the `temp.html` template for the web interface) to the Raspberry Pi.

### 3. Running the System

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the main Python script.
2.  Execute the script using:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3.  The script will start the **Flask web server** on port `8080` and print the robot's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.x.x:8080`).
4.  Open a web browser on a device connected to the **same Wi-Fi network** as the robot and enter the printed IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:8080`).
5.  The web interface will load, allowing you to view the live stream and control the robot's movement.

## üí° Future Scope and Enhancements

The current project is a robust foundation for a surveillance system. Future development could include:

* **Autonomous Navigation:** Integrate **advanced sensors** (ultrasonic, LIDAR) for obstacle avoidance and implement basic autonomous navigation capabilities.
* **AI/ML Integration:** Implement **AI-based algorithms** for features like object detection, facial recognition, or automatic threat recognition.
* **Extended Range:** Incorporate **cellular communication** (3G/4G/5G) for remote operation beyond the local Wi-Fi range.
* **Power Optimization:** Enhance the power management system with higher capacity batteries or solar charging for prolonged operation.
* **Cloud Services:** Add support for **cloud storage** and data analytics for surveillance footage.
