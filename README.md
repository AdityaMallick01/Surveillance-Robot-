# ü§ñ Web-Controlled Surveillance Robot Using Raspberry Pi

## Project Overview

[cite_start]This project details the design and implementation of a **Web-Controlled Surveillance Robot** powered by a **Raspberry Pi** for **real-time remote monitoring**[cite: 17]. [cite_start]The system allows a user to remotely control the robot's movement (forward, backward, left, right) and receive a live video feed via a standard web browser on any internet-enabled device[cite: 18, 89].

[cite_start]The robot functions as an **IoT-enabled device** [cite: 206][cite_start], combining a mobile platform, a camera module, and a lightweight web server (Flask) hosted on the Raspberry Pi[cite: 20]. [cite_start]This makes it a cost-effective, flexible solution suitable for applications in home security, industrial surveillance, and monitoring hazardous environments[cite: 23, 92].

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### 1. Hardware Assembly

1.  [cite_start]**Mount Components:** Assemble the motors, wheels, and Raspberry Pi/Camera Module onto the chassis [cite: 119-121].
2.  [cite_start]**Motor Driver Connection:** Connect the **L298N Motor Driver** to the DC Motors[cite: 358].
3.  [cite_start]**Raspberry Pi Interfacing:** Connect the motor driver's control pins to the designated **GPIO pins** on the Raspberry Pi[cite: 360, 519]. [cite_start]The GPIO pins used in the code are **29, 31, 33, and 35** for `Motor_In1` through `Motor_In4` respectively[cite: 519].
4.  [cite_start]**Camera Connection:** Connect the Pi Camera Module to the Raspberry Pi's CSI port[cite: 19].
5.  [cite_start]**Power:** Connect the power supply to both the Raspberry Pi and the motor driver (ensure correct voltage for each)[cite: 377].

### 2. Software Configuration

1.  [cite_start]**OS and Libraries:** Install the Raspberry Pi OS on the MicroSD card[cite: 372].
2.  **Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries on the Raspberry Pi using the terminal:

    ```bash
    # Install Flask
    pip install Flask

    # Install OpenCV for video processing
    # Use the appropriate command for your RPi OS version
    pip install opencv-python

    # Install the camera control library
    pip install picamera2
    ```

3.  **Code Transfer:** Upload the project code (specifically the `main` script and the `temp.html` template for the web interface) to the Raspberry Pi.

### 3. Running the System

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the main Python script.
2.  Execute the script using:

    ```bash
    python main_code_file_name.py
    ```

3.  [cite_start]The script will start the **Flask web server** on port `8080` [cite: 622] and print the robot's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.x.x:8080`).
4.  Open a web browser on a device connected to the **same Wi-Fi network** as the robot and enter the printed IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:8080`).
5.  [cite_start]The web interface will load, allowing you to view the live stream and control the robot's movement[cite: 109, 163].
